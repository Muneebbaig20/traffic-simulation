# Advanced Traffic Simulation System

## Project Overview

This project simulates an advanced traffic management system using stacks and queues. The system includes functionalities for:
- Simulating traffic flow.
- Controlling traffic lights.
- Handling emergency situations.
- Generating traffic challans.

## Features

1. **Traffic Simulation**:
   - Simulate traffic flow between intersections using a stack.
   - Control traffic lights using a queue.

2. **Manual Traffic Control**:
   - Manually control traffic based on user input for traffic amounts.

3. **Automatic Traffic Light Timing**:
   - Simulate automatic timing for traffic lights.

4. **Emergency Handling**:
   - Stop traffic for emergency situations.

5. **Traffic Challan Generation**:
   - Generate challans for different vehicle types.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
   ```sh
   g++ -o traffic_simulation traffic_simulation.cpp
   ./traffic_simulation.cpp
